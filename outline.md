# Introduction

The Javascript language has come a long way and the pace of new features only
seems to be increasing. We have a lot of new tooling to help us build,
including some great frameworks.

But even if you know everything about Javascript, what else do you need to know?

# The Product

Agile, waterfall or something in between, you undoubtedly have tickets.

# Documentation

!!

# HTML/CSS

How do you know the wind is real?

# Package Management

Bower, NPM

# Frameworks

Vanilla Javascript, Jquery, Angular, React, Vue...

# Version Control

Version Control is crucial in software development.

New features can be built in branches, when development is complete, the
changes in the branch, a Pull Request can be created and reviewed to merge
the changes into the master, or primary branch.

# Debugging

Debugging javascript application used to rely solely on `alert()`.

Many developers still rely heavily on `console.log()`.

Modern browser offer many improved developer tools.

# Testing

Javascript unit testing for small things,

Integration testing, "automated browser testing".

# Deployment

CI/CD, how you get your code into production.
